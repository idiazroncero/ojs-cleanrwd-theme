## Open Journal System Clean, Responsive Theme

Open Journal System is the leading scientific journal manager. It is awesome.

Open Journal System's web design (on its 2.x version) is, however __very__ outdated.

This theme aims to give OJS a clean, minimalistic, responsive and modern-looking air by using nowadays' standards lacking in the original themes:

- Use of @font-face.
- Responsive, mobile-first web design.
- Vertycal rhythm

## Limitations

Sadly, an OJS 2.x theme plugin *only affects CSS*. This means that some outdated techniques - like the excessive use of `table`s - can't be changed, only "outstyled" via CSS.
