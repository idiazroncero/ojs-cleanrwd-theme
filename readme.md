# IN DEVELOPMENT - NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION
## Open Journal System Clean, Responsive Theme

[Open Journal System][ojs] is the leading scientific journal manager. 

It is awesome.

However, Open Journal System's 2.x look and feel is __very__ outdated. If you use the themes shipped with the platform, you'll get a very old-fashioned website.

Scientific journals *can* and *should* be attractive.

This theme aims to give OJS a clean, minimalistic, responsive and modern-looking air by using nowadays' standards lacking in the original themes:

- Use of @font-face.
- Responsive, mobile-first web design.
- Vertycal rhythm

You can use this theme as it is or customize it.

In order to tailor the theme to your needs, you will have to be familiar at least with CSS.

However, this theme will be specifically prepared to easily customizable by using SCSS variables. Just access _init.scss, read the documentation, change the variables to meet your needs and compile your CSS using your weapon of choice.

## Limitations

Sadly, an OJS 2.x theme plugin *only affects CSS*. This means that some outdated techniques - like the excessive use of `table`s - can't be changed, only "outstyled" via CSS.
